    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Anglo-Nepalese War</h1>
    <p>The Anglo-Nepalese War (1 November 1814 – 4 March 1816), also known as the Gorkha War, was fought between the Gorkhali army of the Kingdom of Nepal (present-day Nepal) and the British forces of the East India Company (EIC, present-day India). Both sides had ambitious expansion plans for the mountainous north of the Indian subcontinent. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Sugauli in 1816 AD, which ceded some Nepalese controlled territory to the EIC.<br>
        The British war effort was led by the East India Company and supported by a coalition of native states; the Garhwal Kingdom, the Patiala State and the Kingdom of Sikkim against the Kingdom of Gorkha. The Kingdom of Gorkha's war effort was led mostly by the Thapa Kaji.</p>

          <h3>Role Played by Brave Warriors in the Anglo – Nepal War</h3>
          <h5>Balabhadra Kunwar</h5>
          <h6>Six miles from Deharadun of India in the north- east on the way to Mussoorie there is a place, called Nalapani. It had been the territory of Nepal since long before the Anglo-Nepal War. Balabhadra Kunwar had built a fort on a height of 500 feet at Nalapani, which was known by the name of khalanga fort.
              <br>At the time of the Anglo-Nepal War, Gillespie, the General and Maubi, the colonel had gone to the khalanga fort with 3500 soldiers and 15 guns in their arms. They were divided into four groups for the attack on the fort from all sides. One night before the attack of the khalanga fort, Sir Robert Rolls Gillespie wrote a letter to Balbhadra, asking him to surrender. But Balbhadra tore the letter without going through it and said, ''We don't read a litter at night, I will meet with Gillespie shortly.'' In the next morning, the English side attacked the fort will guns other arms. The men and women responded from inside the fort with guns, arrows and bricks. Mr. Allis, lieutenant, who was advancing to the battlefield to encourage the English force, was killed in the gun firing of the Nepalese soldiers.
              <br>The bereave Nepalese women quenched their thirst with the water of the nearby river even amidst the dreadful situations of the gunfiring. They made their way to another fort of Jitgadh for its security.
              Turning to the English before leaving the palace, Balbhadra said to them in a loud voice, "it was impossible for you to have victory over the fort, but I leave it on my own accord."
              
              <br>The Englishmen had, in honour of the bravery of the Nepalese people, written in a memorial stone the words like "As a tribute of respect for our gallant adversary BULBUDDER, commander of the fort and HIS BRAVE GOORKAS."
         <br> </h6>
         <h5>Amarsingh Thapa</h5>
         <h6>Badakaji Amarsingh Thapa was a son of Bhimsingh Thapa. After the honourable death of Bhimsingh in the battle of Palanchowk, Amarsingh Thapa got this title. A son of a father who was killed in a battle was entitled to get his father's title at that time. The name of Premier Bhimsen Thapa's father was also Amarsingh Thapa but Badakaji Amarsingh Thapa was a different person. He had played an important role at the time of conquest of Baise and Chaubise states. He had expanded the western boundary of Nepal up top the Sutlaj River. The responsibility of the operation of the war in the whole west including Kumaun and Godhawal was entrusted with Amarsingh Thapa. On the side of the English, it was the responsibility of Sir David Octorlony to take care of the operation of the war. At the start of the war, Amarsingh thapa had built a fort at Ramgadh. He fought bravely for the defence of this fort.With the Anglo-Nepal War. Going against Nepal, Nepal was forced to accept the Sugauli Treaty. Frustrated with this, Amarsingh Thapa went to Gosainkunda and breathed his last there.
       <br><br> </h6>
           <h5>Bhakti Thapa</h5>
           <h6> Sardar Bhakti Thapa, as a Godar Thapa of Lamjung fought against the Gorkhalese in the bettle on behalf of the army of Kehari Narayan Shah, the king of Lamjung. In course of time, he joined the Gorkhalese force. During the period of the Anglo-Nepal war, Sardar Amarsingh Thapa was controlling the operation of the war of the whole western Nepal from the fort of Malaun. To the south of this for, was the fort of Surajgadh. As the English army had the control over the fort of Deuthali, 1000 yards to Malaun fort, the security of the whole western region was at stake. This made Bakti Thapa. leave on 4 Baishakh 1872 BS (April 16, 1815) for the battle field with various kinds of knives and swords in his hand together with 2000 Nepalese soldiers amidst the fierce gun firing of the English army all around. There was a fierce gun fience fighting between the two sides. He was hit by the bullet at his heart and killed. He died a death of honour. 700 soldiers were killed on the side of the Nepalese force, while on the side of the English Army; all the officers except only one at the arsenal were killed. Octorlony, the major handed over very respectfully to the Nepalese army, the body of Bhakti thapa worn over by a costly woollen wrapper. Next morning, his body was cremated with due guard of honour. At the end of the war, it took a different turn for the Anglo-Nepal War, because the soldiers in the Nepalese force lost their hope for the better, while the English force soldiers got ever more encouraged.
               <br><br>
           </h6>
           <h5> Bam Shah</h5>
           <h6> Bam Shah was the administrator of Kumaun, deputed there by the premier, Bhimsen Thapa. The Englishmen were taken aback at the activities taken up by him as the administrator. He was working well efficiently with the army force during the period of the Anglo-Nepal war. However, with the propaganda made by the English side about the defeat of the Nepalese force elsewhere, he could not resist the disappointment that swayed upon him. Edward Garner, aware of Bam Shah, getting dissatisfied with Bhimsen Thapa attempted to win him ho his side under the allurement of big offers to him. However, the English side failed in attempt to win Bam Shah, a true patriot of the country.
               <br><br>
           </h6>
           <h5>Ranabir Singh Thapa</h5>
           <h6>  Bhimsen Thapa's youngest brother, Ranabir Singh Thapa was on deputation to Makawanpur during the Anglo-Nepal war of 1871 BS. The army under him defeated very badly the English force. Subsequently, after the war he was appointed the administrator of Palpa and also the junior general of Kalibox and Sabuj battalion. After some time, he became a saint, known by the name of Swami Avayananda .
               <br><br>
           </h6>
           <h5>
            Ujirsingh Thapa</h5>
           <h6>  The premier, Bhimsen Thapa's father General Amarsingh Thapa was a governing Palpa. After the death of Amarsingh Thapa , his grandson, Nayansingh Thapa's Son, Ujirsingh Thapa became the governor of Palpa. In the battle of the Anglo-Nepal war, the English force led by the General Mr.Wood was badly defeated and driven away by Ujirsingh Thapa.
